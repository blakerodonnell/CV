## Skills

Legal Knowledge: My legal training has provided me with deep understanding of how the legal system effects business and this is of use in designing business models and systems. My advice and drafting has generated tens of millions of pounds for clients and saved many individuals from financial ruin. 

Financial: I have raised money for clients embarking on very large transactions and have organised finance worth hundreds of millions. I understand the practical aspects banking and finance. Much of the experience I gained was at a very senior level which would assist me in designing systems in the lawtech/fintech industry. 

Politics: I have been involved with politics for about 10 years as a part-time endeavour. My time spent dealing with internal party dynamics and voters has given me good interpersonal skills, ability to deal with conflicting viewpoints and use of data systems. In recognition of this, I have been invited to interview to be placed on the approved list for parliament.

Creative: I am a creative individual and have the ability to imagine different abstract solutions to problems and how to aesthetically present them. I utilised 3D printing as a novel miniature sculptural technique. In recognition of this my artwork was exhibited at the Royal Academy, Royal Scottish Academy and Mall Galleries. I set up an art event platform as a project and oversaw the design and implementation of the website: www.harbingersarts.com.
